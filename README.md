# OTP Login API ðŸš€

A simple OTP-based authentication service built with **Go**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**, with API docs powered by **Swagger**.  

Users can sign in with their phone number and a one-time password (OTP). Once verified, they receive a **JWT token** to access protected resources.

---

## Features
- OTP login with phone number  
- OTP stored temporarily in Redis with expiry  
- PostgreSQL for persistent user storage  
- JWT authentication (Bearer tokens)  
- Middleware for auth & panic recovery  
- Rate limiting: max 3 OTP requests per phone per 10 minutes  
- Swagger UI for API docs  

---

## Tech Stack
- Go â€“ main backend  
- PostgreSQL â€“ stores user records  
- Redis â€“ caches OTPs + rate limiting  
- JWT â€“ authentication  
- Swaggo â€“ generates Swagger documentation  
- Docker Compose â€“ runs Postgres + Redis locally

## Why PostgreSQL + Redis?

- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable relational DB with ACID compliance. Perfect for permanent storage of users.  
- **Redis**: In-memory store, extremely fast. Ideal for temporary OTP storage and rate limiting.  

Using them together balances performance (Redis) with reliability (Postgres).
